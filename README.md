# Sentiment Anaylsis for Movies Review
- **Overview**
In the digital age, movie reviews significantly influence public opinion and viewing decisions. Given the vast number of online reviews, it's vital to develop tools for automatic sentiment analysis. This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie reviews and classify their sentiment as either positive or negative.

- **Objective**
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately classifies the sentiment of movie reviews. This is achieved by implementing machine learning algorithms and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) feature extraction technique.

## Techniques Used
- **Data Preparation**
  - Text Cleaning: Removal of stopwords, punctuation, and other irrelevant characters.
  - Text Standardization: Lowercasing and stemming to ensure consistency in text data.
  - TF-IDF Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical features for model input.

- **Model Implementation**
  - Machine Learning Algorithms: Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier
  - Deep Learning: LSTM  networks.
  - Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy used to select the best-performing model.

## Kaggle Competition

This project was hosted as a competition on Kaggle, where I secured the 13th rank on the leaderboard.
